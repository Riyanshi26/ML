### New York Taxi Fare Prediction

Given the Kaggle dataset of the taxi prices in New York, with with many features provided, we had to do Pre-processing, visualize the data and train the data on various linear regresiion models.

### Life Expectancy (WHO)
The data was collected from WHO and the United Nations website. Our objective was to perform data-preprocessing, do data visualization and do feature-seletion as there were a lot of features and only some of them were actually affecting life expectancy.

### Vehicle Classification (multi-class)
We train an ML model to break a Hcaptcha by making a multi-class classification model that can classify vehicles into 7 different classes. First we did the pre-processing for the data 
and then tried classification through different approaches - KNN classifier, SVM classifier.
